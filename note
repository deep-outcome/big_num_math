relaxed
    - nth prime/prime gen (space/time wise)    
    - check for general radix method

noticeable    
    - inspect mulmul without intermediate product: to be better only stack must employed (no Vec writes) => addition method split
    - make pow log effecient
    - mulmul escape for 0 multiplier
    - check once again whether division is "im"possible (avoid substracting)    

tough
    - array of usizes: reduces memory footprint twice per byte (1001=9, 1001 1001 = 9 9), implies direct binary operation to preserve adequate performance

questionable
    - reflect to lite, especially to mishmas proj:
        - mulmul escape for 0 multiplier
    - make computations safe against overflow
