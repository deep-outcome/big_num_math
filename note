easy
 - don't use array in prime_ck (check other array reductions) 

fun ideas
    - sin, cos, tg, cotg (Taylor series)


IMPROVEMENTS    

tough
    - array of usizes: reduces memory footprint twice per byte (1001=9, 1001 1001 = 9 9), implies direct binary operation to preserve adequate performance
