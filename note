- validate divrem usage, check with divrem decremental usage
- validate no division by zero
- validate division by greater dividend
- new_from_str_row
- rename:
    - mul_dynamo -> multiplication
    - pow_dynamo -> power
    - divrem -> division_with_remainder
    - divrem_dynamo -> -> division_with_remainder_dynamo
- move divrems to second group
- consider adding shrink to add and divrem    


IMPROVEMENTS    

tough
    - array of usizes: reduces memory footprint twice per byte (1001=9, 1001 1001 = 9 9), implies direct binary operation to preserve adequate performance
